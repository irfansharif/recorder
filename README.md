Recorder

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/irfansharif/recorder.svg)](https://godocs.io/github.com/irfansharif/recorder)

Recorder is a handy little library that lets you record a set of operations and
then replay from the recordings, which provides a handy way to mock out
components being recorded. Operations are defined only by a 'command' and a
corresponding 'output'; see [grammar](#grammar) below. Recorders have very real
ergonomic advantages:
- Mocked data is easily auto-generated by simply "capturing the real thing"
- Recordings are human readable, making it easy to git-diff behavioural changes
- There's no need to litter the codebase with testable-but-clunky interfaces

This library is similar in spirit to
[cockroachdb/copyist](https://github.com/cockroachdb/copyist). For real world
usage, see [cockroachdb/dev](https://github.com/cockroachdb/dev)
where it's used to mock out all attempts to shell out (through `exec.Command`).
It also intercepts all OS operations (`os.{Mkdir,Remove,Symlink}`). (Also see
[example/](https://github.com/irfansharif/recorder/tree/main/example).)

---

Users will typically want to embed a recorder into structs that oversee the
sort of side-effect or I/O they'd like to capture and later playback from
(as opposed to "doing the real thing" in tests). These side-effects can be
arbitrary. If we're building a CLI that calls into the filesystem to filter for
a set of files and writes out their contents to a zip file, the I/O could be
the listing out for files, and the side-effects would include creating the zip
file.

I/O could also be calling into anything that sits outside some package
boundary. The recorder, if embedded into the package, let's us:
- Record the set of outbound calls, and the relevant responses, while
"doing the real thing"
- Play back from an earlier recording, intercepting all outbound calls and
effectively mocking out all dependencies the component has

### Example

Let us try and mock out a globber. Broadly what it could look like is as
follows:

```go
type globber struct {
	*recorder.Recorder
}

// glob returns the names of all files matching the given pattern.
func (g *globber) glob(pattern string) []string {
	output, _ := g.Next(pattern, func() (string, error) {
		matches, _ := filepath.Glob(pattern) // do the real thing

		output := fmt.Sprintf("%s\n", strings.Join(matches, "\n"))
		return output, nil
	})

	matches := strings.Split(strings.TrimSpace(output), "\n")
	return matches
}
```

All we had to do was define tiny bi-directional parsers to convert our input
and output to the human-readable string form Recorders understand. Strung
together. we can build tests that would plumb in Recorders with the right mode
and play back from them when asked for. See
[example/](https://github.com/irfansharif/recorder/tree/main/example) for this
test pattern, where it behaves differently depending on whether or not
`-record` is specified.

```sh
$ go test -run TestExample -record
PASS
ok      github.com/irfansharif/recorder/example 0.708s

$ cat testdata/recording
testdata/files/*
----
testdata/files/aaa
testdata/files/aab
testdata/files/aac

$ go test -run TestExample # also much faster!
PASS
ok      github.com/irfansharif/recorder/example 0.097s
```

When playing back from it, we wouldn't actually need to reach into the
file-system. The results from an earlier run were already recorded; we'd just
use that instead.

Once the recordings are captured, they can be edited and maintained by hand.
An example of where we might want to do that is for recordings for commands
that generate copious amounts of output (like fetching from some API). It
suffices for us to trim the recording down by hand, and make sure we don't
re-record over it (by inspecting the diffs during review). Recordings, like
regular mocks, are expected to get checked in as fixtures.

## Grammar

The printed form of an operation (the base unit of what can be recorded) is
defined by the following grammar. This is what's used when generating/reading
from recording files.

```
# comment
<command> \
<that wraps over onto the next line>
----
<output>
```

By default `<output>` cannot contain blank lines. This alternative syntax
allows for it:

```
<command>
----
----
<output>

<more output>
----
----
```

Callers are free to use `<output>` to model external errors as well; it's all
opaque to Recorders. The syntax was borrowed from
[cockroachdb/datadriven](https://github.com/cockroachdb/datadriven).
